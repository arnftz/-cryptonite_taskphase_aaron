### Flag
* flag: picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_55662c16}
### Thought Process
* the hint showed its an XXE vuln
* so i went to inspect, found the js and html files
* the post link is link of url/data
* also when you press a button, an xml entry is created and the format can be seen in the network tab
* ```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><data><ID>1</ID></data>```
* from this i created a payload using chatgpt
* posted it using curl onto the endpoint
### Steps Taken
* inspect the html and js files
* find the endpoint for xml injection
* find template for xml injection
* create a payload similar to input
* deploy payload using curl to the endpoint
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>
  <ID>&xxe;</ID>
</data>
```
